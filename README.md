# Neural Network Calculator

### First Commit:
That's a project that I loved to make to automate a homework that's been assigned to me.
And I found it quite interesting.

However, Python is still a horrible language to use.

### Multiclass Activation Functions:
1. Now I've upgraded the system, and it now has more built-in activation functions.
2. I've added the ability to use multiclass activation functions, such as the built-in Softmax.
3. Refined some of the project and fixed bugs.
4. Added the ability to control what happens to each layer at any given calculation stage.

### GUI Introduced:
Now we're talking, I'm upgrading the system to use GUIs.
And for some reason python libraries suck at doing this, so I'm building my own shell around them.

### Input Frame:
1. Added the ability to control how many inputs to, well, input.
2. Made a custom controllable and configurable input field.
