# Neural Network Calculator

### First Commit:

That's a project that I loved to make to automate a homework that's been assigned to me.
And I found it quite interesting.

However, Python is still a horrible language to use.

### Layered Activation Functions:

1. Now I've upgraded the system, and it now has more built-in activation functions.
2. I've added the ability to use layered activation functions, such as the built-in Softmax.
3. Refined some of the project and fixed bugs.
